  <p>[00:42Z] Echo-5 Node: &#x27;Visual confirmed — two targets exiting cover northwest quadrant. Requesting thermal lock.&#x27;</p>
<p>[00:43Z] Control: &#x27;Thermal acquired. Falcon-2 rerouted. Weapons hold until confirmation. Transmit burst now.&#x27;</p>
<p>[00:44Z] — Partial burst — &#x27;Secondary heat bloom detected. Possibly decoy. Hold strike. Await confirmation from Echo-7.&#x27;</p>
<p>These transmissions were intercepted by NATO listening posts monitoring encrypted RF chatter along the Zaporizhzhia frontline.</p>
<p>Analysts confirmed key exchanges were consistent with Type V2 military-grade cipher protocols used by elite Russian recon teams.</p>
<p>Timing and phrasing matched known patterns from 2023 eastern Donbas intercepts, suggesting reused comms doctrine.</p>
<p>Metadata tagging indicates at least three origin points — likely mobile signal repeaters mounted on all-terrain vehicles.</p>
<p>Voiceprint overlays tentatively match with operators previously tracked during Kharkiv operations in Q4 2024.</p>
<p>Ongoing decryption efforts are focused on fragmented hash blocks captured during packet collision events — possible embedded GPS or tasking data.</p>
