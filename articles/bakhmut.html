  <p>Russian tactical repositioning around Bakhmut has intensified, with armored units relocating westward to reinforce defensive lines in anticipation of Ukrainian flanking attempts.</p>
<p>Drone surveillance has confirmed the setup of new trenches and fortified machine gun nests along the elevated terrain northeast of Ivanivske.</p>
<p>Combat engineers have laid mines and constructed anti-vehicle barriers on key approach routes, while thermal netting was observed being deployed over camouflaged artillery positions.</p>
<p>The 76th Guards Air Assault Division was detected moving through woodland corridors, maintaining strict radio silence and infrared suppression techniques.</p>
<p>Satellite analysis reveals increased logistical traffic from Popasna, with fuel convoys arriving every 6 hours to support redeployed battalions.</p>
<p>Russian signals intelligence has reportedly jammed local Ukrainian drone communications in a 3 km radius west of Bakhmut, suggesting a layered EW perimeter.</p>
<p>Command nodes appear to have shifted underground, utilizing previously abandoned urban infrastructure to protect high-value C2 assets.</p>
<p>Ukrainian forces have countered with precision HIMARS strikes targeting Russian staging areas near Chasiv Yar, causing visible damage in post-strike ISR imagery.</p>
<p>Local partisan reports indicate rapid Russian troop cycling, possibly to maintain readiness or to mask true force strength in the area.</p>
