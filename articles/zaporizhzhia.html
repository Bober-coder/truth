  <p>Joint reconnaissance efforts over southern Zaporizhzhia executed a 72-hour drone sweep using a combination of NATO ISR platforms and Ukrainian rotary UAVs.</p>
<p>Imagery confirmed vehicular movements west of Robotyne, including camouflaged BM-21 Grad launchers rotating firing positions every 2–3 hours.</p>
<p>Bayraktar TB2 drones recorded artillery heat blooms and movement trails leading into woodland dispersal points, indicating high-tempo repositioning.</p>
<p>Signal intercepts suggest active Russian EW units operating from concealed bunkers, disrupting drone control links with intermittent RF bursts.</p>
<p>Micro-UAVs were deployed for close-in surveillance of trench networks, transmitting encrypted heat maps to forward command posts.</p>
<p>High-altitude drones maintained persistent overwatch, mapping nighttime vehicle dispersion patterns to assess refueling cycle routines.</p>
<p>Intermittent anti-air launches were logged, likely man-portable systems reacting to drone noise signatures at sub-400m altitudes.</p>
<p>Post-sweep reports indicate at least three Russian logistics nodes were positively ID’d and relayed to long-range artillery units.</p>
<p>This sweep marks the first documented use of AI-aided terrain triangulation by forward-deployed Ukrainian recon teams.</p>
