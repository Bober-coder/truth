  <p>Following repeated Ukrainian shelling of fixed bridges, Russian forces in Kherson have transitioned to mobile logistics operations supported by pontoon assemblies.</p>
<p>The 45th Engineering Regiment completed a temporary river crossing near Oleshky within 36 hours, enabling low-profile night transfers of fuel and ammunition.</p>
<p>Convoy spacing has been reduced to sub-kilometer intervals, with route variability employed to confuse pattern analysis by NATO ISR assets.</p>
<p>Russian trucks are increasingly camouflaged with locally sourced materials and thermal deflection panels to evade aerial detection.</p>
<p>Movement has shifted to nighttime only, utilizing blackout conditions and river mist to conceal crossings.</p>
<p>Open-source intercepts captured encrypted traffic referencing &#x27;Checkpoint Veles,&#x27; believed to be a mobile depot situated along the east bank staging line.</p>
<p>IR satellite footage revealed heat anomalies consistent with diesel tankers positioned under heavy canopy cover.</p>
<p>Despite efforts, at least two pontoon crossings were damaged in recent HIMARS strikes, briefly halting logistics flow for 12 hours.</p>
<p>Reinforcement operations are reportedly being re-routed through Crimean rail heads and redistributed eastward.</p>
