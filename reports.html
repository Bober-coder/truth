    <h3>⚠️ Recon Sector Update: April 18–24, 2025</h3>
    <p>ISR platforms recorded significant Russian repositioning across the Bakhmut-Soledar corridor. Aerial recon identified three new entrenchment lines, supported by thermal traces from supply vehicle movements occurring between 0100 and 0400 daily. Analysts confirm at least two BM-21 launch batteries have been rotated into defilade positions east of the river bend.</p>
    <p>ELINT intercepts also suggest the presence of a new electronic warfare node, codenamed “Prism Echo,” operating in jamming cycles consistent with previous Kherson field deployments. This node disrupted at least two Bayraktar drone control links over a 6-hour window on April 21st. Further signal triangulation is underway.</p>
